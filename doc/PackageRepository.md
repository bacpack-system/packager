# Package Repository

The Package Repository (or Git Lfs) is used for storage of built Packages/Apps. It is a git repository
at the same time. The git tool is used for managing consistent storage of Packages/Apps.

## Behaviour

### Package Repository consistency check

At the start of `build-package`, `build-app` and `create-sysroot` commands the Package Repository
consistency check is performed. The check consists of these steps:

1) Git status check
   - If the git status in Package Repository is not empty, the state of Repository is considered as
   non-consistent and the script ends with error. The user should then clean the Repository and
   continue. It is a bug if the non-consistent state is caused by `bap-builder` itself.
2) Comparing Configs currently in Context and built Packages/Apps in Package Repository
   - If in Package Repository there is any version of Package/App which is not in Context, the
   Package Repository is considered as non-consistent and the script ends with error. User needs to
   fix this problem manually and then continue.
   - If some Packages/Apps are in Context and are not in Package Repository, only warning is
   printed.

All files in `(app|package)/<DISTRO_NAME>/<DISTRO_VERSION/MACHINE_TYPE>` are checked, so any other
files in this directory (alongside Package directories) will be counted as an error. User can't add
any files here manually.

### Managing Packages in Package Repository

Following rules ans mechanisms ensures that the Package Repository is always consistent.

- Each succesfully built Package/App by `build-package`/`build-app` command is copied to Package
Repository (specified by cli flag) to specific path -
`<DISTRO_NAME>/<DISTRO_VERSION/MACHINE_TYPE/PACKAGE_NAME>`
- After all Packages/Apps are succesfully built, all copied files in Package Repository are git
committed and remain in Repository
- If any build fails or the script is interrupted, all copied Packages/Apps are removed from
Repository
