# Package Dependencies

Each Package can have a one or more dependencies.

Basically, we can divide Package dependencies into two sets

- System dependencies - dependencies that must be installed on the host system,
- Local dependencies - dependencies that are delivered with a Package.

The "Dependencies" in our context mean "Local dependencies".

System dependencies are part of the Docker image and must be present on the host system.
